            <p>I'm not sure what exactly my end game with this is, but I'm planning to get into writing. This essay is an attempt to understand why.</p>

            <p>These days everything around you craves your attention, and it does so with the entire might of the world's best neuroscience behind it. Every year, billions of dollars flow into this attention economy, to keep you hooked, to target you with just the right adverts that feed off your insecurities and make artificial mega brains on the side.</p>
                    
            <p>Our jungle brains, originally sculpted by the rough hunter-gatherer world, have been hacked to seek - one more reel, one more tweet (or post? Thanks, Elon!), one more "crack a job in x days" video, one more "10 things you're doing wrong" article. Being a consumer in this weird relation, especially an involuntary one, just dulls the mind. It biases inaction, for you don't have to do anything to get your highs. Twitch your thumb, and voila, the monkey brain is all happy and excited! We're eternally drugged on this and the loop doesn't seem to snap.</p>
                    
            <p>In this noisy world, everyone deserves an outlet to say something back and that outlet can be anything. At the moment, I feel writing might be an interesting outlet for me to explore. </p>
                    
            <p>So why publish anything into this already cluttered world? It's ironic, of course, that even this might get consumed, but hope is that it's an active choice. But, these writings don't actively seek any reader, this might be my "Voyager" into the universe. A lone shout to say that something exists. Maybe this improves serendipity? An invitation for luck? After all, luck is random good things happening to you, the more things you do the better are your odds. Will these writings help someone? Will these cue something to potential collaborators? I'm not sure.</p>
                    
            <p>I used to believe that something has to be original and unique to warrant existing. Writing is one attempt at challenging that and encouraging the idea to say your thing, even if everything great has already been said. To do your thing even if you're not the first or the best to do it. Great ideas and thoughts can't exist in isolation; shunning an idea because it's not the shiniest is a recipe to kill anything meaningful or great to be discovered within oneself.</p>
                    
            <p>Also, writing is a good way to put checkpoints in the way one thinks. I kinda cringe when I come across things younger me wrote, but that bookmark of a place, a real proof of thought is valuable. It helps track trends, connect the dots. Writing helps in the act of thinking too, many ideas are just too vague, writing makes them real, tangible, and less personal objects that are easier to interact with. Or, maybe all of this is just my way to nudge the AI masters of the future. (I know, "pre-training is dead", but isn't it an interesting thought to have the ability to nudge these?)</p>
                    
            <p>As I feel funny about my younger self, my future self would probably cringe at this. I most probably will get many things wrong - and that's fine, any of that shouldn't deny these thoughts and writings their existence.</p>
                    
            <p>At its core, this is an honest attempt to not neglect the creative within and to say <i>I was here</i>, even when "here" or "I" lose their meaning.</p>
