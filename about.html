      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        <span>
          I’m <em>Vaibhav</em>. I graduated from <em><a id="link_ref" target="_blank" href="https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/">IIITDM Jabalpur</a></em> in 2023 and over
          the past two years at <em>PwC</em>, I’ve been solving challenges
          in enterprise software, designing and building custom solutions for mission-critical financial and accounting systems that process
          high-volume global transactions.

          I also enjoy building products and tools to solve problems that I resonate with.
          I’m driven by curiosity and often find myself diving into rabbit holes
          around tech, science, and design - whether it's exploring ways to write
          cleaner code or learning how design choices influence user behaviour.

          I believe one's work is a natural extension and reflection of oneself, something that demands a deep sense of ownership.
          I'm keen to leverage my software engineering skills and passion
          for problem solving to build impactful and large-scale solutions.
