          Hi there! I’m Vaibhav. I like to think of myself as a problem solver
          for hire. After graduating from <em>IIITDM Jabalpur</em> in 2023, Over
          the past 1.5 years at <em>PwC</em>, I’ve been helping solve challenges
          in enterprise software, designing and implementing highly
          configurable solutions on mission-critical financial systems handling
          billions of dollars in annual transactions - streamlining and automating key
          processes and supporting their complex reporting needs.

          Outside work, I'm passionate about building tools to solve problems that I resonate with. Recently,
          I've built a few chrome extensions now used by ~100 people worldwide.
          I’m driven by curiosity and often find myself diving into rabbit holes
          about tech, science, and design — whether it’s exploring ways to write
          cleaner, more efficient code or exploring the psychology and design
          principles that resonate with the users.
        </span>

        <span>
          I'm also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - and am excited to
          leverage my software engineering skills, cloud knowledge, and passion
          for problem solving to build impactful, large-scale applications.
